# HolidaysFinder #

HolidaysFinder allows you to view holidays in Canada and favorite and filter them.
It was built using React, Create React App, and Redux, as well as assorted middleware and packages. The data is sent from a Rails API backend with archived data from <https://calendarific.com/>.

## Installation ##

Clone down this repository and navigate into the program folder. Then execute the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ cd HolidaysFinderBackend
$ bundle install
$ rake start
```

While using the app, you can find Canadian holidays (2019 only) by filtering by date and location, and filter them by observance type.
