# TodaysHolidays #

TodaysHolidays is a Flatiron school portfolio project. It allows you to view holidays in Canada and favorite and filter them. It was built using React, Create React App, and Redux, as well as assorted middleware and npm packages. The data is sent from a Rails API backend with archived data from <https://calendarific.com/>.

## Installation ##

Clone down this repository and navigate into the program folder. Then execute the following commands:
```
$ cd TodaysHolidaysBackend
